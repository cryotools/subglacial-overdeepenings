## Future Glacial Lakes in High Mountain Asia - Modeling and Risk Analysis
### Introduction
With this dataset, we present the first inventory of subglacial overdeepenings 
indicating possible locations of future glacial lakes for the entire region of 
High Mountain Asia. We include an assessment of the hazard of 
mass movement impacts for each lake which, combined with the lake volume, 
gives a first-order impression of the potential glacial lake outburst flood (GLOF) 
hazard at a given location.

This dataset can be used for anticipating emerging threats and potentials 
connected to glacial lakes and as a basis for further studies at 
suspected GLOF hazard hotspots.

The related study is part of the [GLAMoR](https://hu.berlin/glamor) project 
(Future **G**lacial **L**akes in High Mountain **A**sia -
**Mo**deling and **R**isk Analysis) at the Geography Department of 
Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin.
